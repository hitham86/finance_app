 I crafted a spine-chilling horror experience using C# and Unity. In this project, I conceptualized and implemented terrifying gameplay elements, including eerie environments, complex puzzles, and menacing adversaries. Leveraging my expertise in game design and programming, I created an immersive and suspenseful atmosphere that captivated players and kept them engaged. This project not only honed my technical skills in C# and Unity but also demonstrated my ability to create emotionally impactful and visually compelling game experiences.
